I aim to provide empirical evidence on how these independent concepts contribute to shaping ones beliefs on treatment of race in education. The results of this study will show all the factors affect ones beliefs on treatment of race in education. This study explores the effects of social position, personal experiences, and schooling practices on beliefs about the treatment of race in education, specifically measuring whether individuals perceive racial inequality in educational settings as the result of discrimination. Findings will be of interest to schools because this will allow schools to finding problems within their cirrculum and vital ways to build an inclusive environment.
